# moodify
An R project designed to allow people to auto-curate their unorganized playlists into different moods/emotions

The project uses clustering methods (Ward.D method in particular, minimizing within cluster variance) as well as Principal Component Analysis to form and verify the clusters formed. 
Afterwards, it uses the httr package and OAuth access methods to add the songs to the pre-setup playlists on spotify. 
You can find the auto-curated playlists in the link below:
