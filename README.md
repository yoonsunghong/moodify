# moodify
+ This project uses a spotify playlist to group the songs into matching musical color.
+ Project uses clustering methods, particularly through minimizing within-cluter variances (Ward.D), to form songs into clusters and addthem into separate playlists. The project also uses principal component analysis to analyze and verify that the clusters really do exist. 
+ You can find the clustered playlists here:
+ Playlist 1: https://open.spotify.com/user/spider3003/playlist/2eiPgxPpLZWraUDfZTuQUH?si=3S_MZhj4Spmz5UHP0NomDA
