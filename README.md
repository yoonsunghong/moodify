# previous-projects
+ This repository serves as portfolio of some of my previous projects done at school and internships.
+ **R-projects** folder consists of my work done in R (R studio) in both my internship environments and academic environments. 
+ Please refer [to this folder](https://github.com/yoonsunghong/previous-projects/tree/master/R-projects/NBA) to see the work done in R at my current internship (LA Lakers).
+ [Example of work I have done in R](https://github.com/yoonsunghong/previous-projects/blob/master/R-projects/NBA/indicators/code/production/indicators.R)
+ **Internship** folder consists of research projects and data processing in Excel. Some baseball players analysis was done after data processing using Stata but there is no saved record of this due to confidentiality reasons with the team.
+ The baseball analysis done was at a professional Korean baseball team called [Nexen Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nexen_Heroes).
+ I am always looking to learn and do more! Please don't hesistate to email me at yoonsung.h@berkeley.edu.
